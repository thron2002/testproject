* Set the environment and libraries;
libname mydata '/path/to/your/data';

* Import data from multiple CSV files;
proc import datafile='/path/to/your/data/mydata.csv'
    out=mydata.raw_data
    dbms=csv
    replace;
run;

proc import datafile='/path/to/your/data/additional.csv'
    out=mydata.additional_data
    dbms=csv
    replace;
run;

proc import datafile='/path/to/your/data/third_source.csv'
    out=mydata.third_data
    dbms=csv
    replace;
run;

* Use SQL to preprocess and merge data from different sources;
proc sql;
    * Preprocessing first dataset;
    create table work.first_preprocessed as
    select *, (age*12) as age_months from mydata.raw_data
    where age is not null;

    * Preprocessing second dataset;
    create table work.second_preprocessed as
    select key_variable, sum(income) as total_income
    from mydata.additional_data
    group by key_variable;

    * Join first and second datasets;
    create table work.joined_data as
    select a.*, b.total_income
    from work.first_preprocessed as a
    left join work.second_preprocessed as b
    on a.key_variable = b.key_variable;

    * Use third data source for further enhancement;
    create table work.enhanced_data as
    select a.*, b.special_feature
    from work.joined_data as a
    left join mydata.third_data as b
    on a.key_variable = b.key_variable;
quit;

* Perform statistical analysis;
proc sql;
    * Calculate additional statistics after data enhancement;
    create table work.final_stats as
    select mean(age_months) as avg_age_months, mean(total_income) as avg_total_income
    from work.enhanced_data
    where total_income is not null;
quit;

* Logistic Regression on enhanced data;
proc logistic data=work.enhanced_data;
    model binary_variable(event='1') = age_months total_income special_feature / selection=stepwise;
    output out=work.model_output p=pred;
run;

* Generate ROC curve;
ods graphics on;
proc sgplot data=work.model_output;
    title 'Enhanced Model ROC Curve';
    roc x=pred y=binary_variable;
run;
ods graphics off;
